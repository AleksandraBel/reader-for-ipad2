# Project Summary: reader-for-ipad2

This document summarizes the state of the project and the modifications made on August 19, 2025.

## Initial State

The project started as a simple parallel reader application. Its core functionality was to display two text files (`sample.txt` and `sample_ru.txt`) side-by-side. The original text was in a main, scrollable view, and the translation was in a static top panel with a standard scrollbar. Highlighting was done on a per-paragraph basis.

## Summary of Changes (August 19, 2025)

Today, we significantly enhanced the application's user interface and functionality.

### 1. Drag-to-Scroll Translation Panel
- **Change:** The standard scrollbar on the top translation panel was hidden.
- **Implementation:** We added CSS to hide the scrollbar and JavaScript logic to enable horizontal scrolling by clicking and dragging the mouse. The cursor changes to `grab` and `grabbing` to provide visual feedback.

### 2. Dynamic Translation Panel
- **Change:** The translation panel is now hidden by default to provide a cleaner reading interface.
- **Implementation:**
    - The panel now appears with a smooth animation only when a user clicks on a word in the main (original) text.
    - The panel can be dismissed by clicking on it, causing it to slide back out of view.
    - CSS `transform: translateY()` and transitions were used for the animations.

### 3. Content Update
- **Change:** The sample texts were replaced with the full versions of "Moby Dick" in English and Russian.
- **Implementation:** The file paths in `script.js` were updated to point to `books/Moby-Dick.txt` and `books/Moby-Dick(ru).txt`.

### 4. Word-level Highlighting
- **Change:** The application can now highlight individual words, not just entire paragraphs.
- **Implementation:**
    - The text processing logic in `script.js` was rewritten to wrap every single word in both texts in a `<span>` tag with a unique, corresponding ID (`data-word-id`).
    - Clicking an English word now highlights it and its corresponding Russian word in the translation panel.
    - **Note:** This is a positional mapping, so its accuracy depends on the similarity of sentence structure between the original and the translation.

### 5. Pagination System
- **Change:** The infinite scroll for the main text was replaced with a page-based navigation system.
- **Implementation:**
    - Added "Previous" and "Next" buttons and a page number display to `index.html`.
    - The core logic in `script.js` was refactored to:
        - Load the entire book into memory.
        - Calculate the total number of pages based on a fixed number of paragraphs per page (`paragraphsPerPage`).
        - Render only the paragraphs for the current page.
    - CSS was updated to correctly position the new pagination controls and fix layout issues, ensuring the buttons are always visible at the bottom of the screen.

## Current State

The application is now a much more feature-rich and interactive e-reader. It supports word-to-word translation highlighting and a clean, paginated interface.
